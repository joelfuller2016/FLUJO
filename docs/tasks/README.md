    B --> D[Task C2: Flow Pattern Storage]
    C --> E[Task D1: Natural Language Generation]
    D --> E
```

### Prerequisites
- [x] MCP servers installed in `/mcp-servers/` directory
- [x] GitHub issues created and organized
- [x] PROJECT_PLAN.md updated with MCP-first priorities
- [x] Task documentation created for core implementation

## Getting Started - Developer Guide

### 1. Environment Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/joelfuller2016/FLUJO.git
cd FLUJO

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Verify MCP servers are available
ls mcp-servers/
# Should show: mcp-reasoner, sequential-thinking, memory, etc.
```

### 2. Next Immediate Action
**Start with Task B1 (task-381) - MCP-Reasoner Integration**

1. Read detailed implementation guide: [Task B1 Documentation](./task-b1-mcp-reasoner-integration.md)
2. Focus on: `src/backend/execution/flow/FlowExecutor.ts`
3. Expected time: 2-3 hours
4. Creates foundation for all intelligent features

### 3. Development Workflow
```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/task-381-mcp-reasoner-integration

# Follow implementation guide
# - Update FlowExecutor.ts with reasoning analysis
# - Create ReasonerIntegrationService.ts
# - Add unit tests and integration tests

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "feat: implement mcp-reasoner integration (task-381)"
